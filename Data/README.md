## The csv files

### Marginal_Cost_Weekly_Mean.csv
Contains the weekly mean of the marginal cost of operation in the Sudeste/Centro-Oeste subsystem.
The marginal cost refers to the cost of producing an extra KWh of energy. 

#### Variables
- **Start_of_week**: Date of the start of the week. 
- **Date**: Last day of the corresponding week. 
- **Marginal_cost_mean_week**: Weekly mean marginal cost, in Brazilian Reals per MWh. 

### Stored_Energy.csv
Contains the energy in storage at the Sudeste/Centro-Oeste subsystem each day.

#### Variables
- **Date**: Day.
- **Stored_energy**: energy in storage at the given day, in GWh. 

(**Note:** to compute the energy produced on day *x* that was stored that day, we would need to compute the difference between the values of *Stored_enegy* at days *x* and *$x-1*.)
